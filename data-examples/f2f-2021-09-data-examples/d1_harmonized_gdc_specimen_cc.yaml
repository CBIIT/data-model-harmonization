  Title: GDC Specimen Example - Sept 2021 F2F Demonstrator 1
  Schema: ccdh.0713cc.Specimen
  Description:
    - "CRDC-H-compliant representation of the synthetic source data example described here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t02d9shmUHrYrV7IPUeAIAyY3e45AYpTN53HzjyKdag/edit#gid=920835556"
    - "**FOR EASIEST VIEWING TURN WORD WRAP OFF SO THAT COMMENTS DON'T RUN ONTO A NEW LINE**"
    - "In this example enumerated values are captured using a CodeableConcept object, which bundles one or more Coding object that holds a single concept code and supporting metadata."
    - "Here each CodeableConcept holds up to two Codings - one for the harmonized code and one for the code used in the original source data."

  Example:                                                        # type = Specimen
    id: "f2f:05f1574e-2a28-50bc-bdc1-e4c6dee92fd1"                # Local uuid for the Specimen a assigned by the system in which this record lives (here, the CCDH F2F Demonstrator).
    identifier:                                                   # type = Identifier   (Identifier is a complex data type, but we are only showing a single field from this type)  
      - value: "target:TARGET-40-0A4I9I-01A"                      # GDC.Sample.sample_submitter_id
