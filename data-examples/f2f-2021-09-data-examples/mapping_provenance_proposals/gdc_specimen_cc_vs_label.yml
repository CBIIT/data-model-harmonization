# Note that the 'Coding' entity has other fields not used here, that would  allow capturing things like the version of the code system, a specific value set that the code is part of.

# Approach discussed on the Internal call on 9-15-21 where we punt on proposing any specific representation for the pilot,
# and just capture enumerated values as text literals with the formal code in a comment.
# We can say there are proposals in the works for how to formally place the code and orignal value provenance in the data.
# The issue with this 'punting' approach is that the data examples are pretty unsatisfactory, and make it look like we really havent done anything useful with terminologies.
