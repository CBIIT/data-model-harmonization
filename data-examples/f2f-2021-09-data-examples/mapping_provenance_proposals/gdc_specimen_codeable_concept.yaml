  Title: GDC Specimen Example - Codeable Concept Proposal
  Schema: ccdh.0713.Specimen
  Description:
    - "CRDC-H-compliant representation of the synthetic source data example described here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t02d9shmUHrYrV7IPUeAIAyY3e45AYpTN53HzjyKdag/edit#gid=920835556"
    - Demonstrates a Codeable Concept based proposal for capturing formal coded enums and original source values, co-located with human readable values in a single Codeable Concept object in the data message.
    - Shows only a handful of fields form the original example record, to illustrate the proposed pattern.
    - "For easiest viewing, **TURN WORD WRAP OFF** so that comments don't run onto a new line."
